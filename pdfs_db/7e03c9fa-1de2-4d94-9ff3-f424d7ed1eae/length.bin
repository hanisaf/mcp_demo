Where do valuable contributions originate from in online innovation commu-\nnities? Prior research provides con ﬂicting answers. One view, consistent with a community\nof practice perspective, is that valued knowledge contributions are primarily provided by\ncentral participants at the core of a community. In contrast, other research —including\nwork adopting an open innovation perspective —predicts that valuable ideas primarily\nemerge from peripheral participants, those at the margins of a ﬁeld of knowledge who\nprovide novel ideas and viewpoints. We integrate these contrasting perspectives by\nconsidering two distinct forms of position: social embeddedness (a core social position\nwithin the social network of participants interacting within a community) and epistemic\nmarginality (a peripheral epistemic position based on the network of topics discussed by a\ncommunity). Analyzing contributions by 697,412 participants of 52 Stack Exchange online\ninnovation communities, we ﬁnd that both participants who are socially embedded and\nparticipants who are epistemically marginal provide knowledge contributions that are\nhighly valued by fellow community participants. Importantly, among epistemically\nmarginal participants, those with high social embeddedness are more likely to provide\ncontributions valued by the community; by virtue of their epistemic marginality, these\nparticipants may offer novel ideas while by virtue of their social embeddedness they may\nbe able to more effectively communicate their ideas to the community. Thus, the pro-\nduction of knowledge in an online innovation community involves a complex interaction\nbetween the novelty emanating from the epistemic periphery and the social embeddedness\nrequired to make ideas congruent with existing social and epistemic norms.\nOpen Access Statement: This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial-\nNoDerivatives 4.0 International License.

Introduction\nT h et e n s i o nb e t w e e nt h ec o r ea n dt h ep e r i p h e r ya st h e\nprimary source of valuable ideas has been observed\nacross various ﬁelds of knowledge. In many contexts,\nknowledge generation occurs when existing ideas\nand concepts are further developed by a core com-\nmunity of knowledge seekers dwelling in a shared ep-\nistemic community (Polanyi 1958,L a v ea n dW e n g e r\n1991,B o l a n da n dT e n k a s i 1995). As a result, central\nparticipants in a knowledge ﬁeld are likely to possess\nthe expertise and status to have the contextualized\nunderstanding and social in tegration necessary forengaging with new ideas. In other settings, however,\nparticipants who are peripheral to a knowledge ﬁeld\nprovide creative approaches to solve problems. Pe-\nripheral participants have often been found to be the\nsource of novel insight, contributing ideas from dif-\nferent institutional ﬁelds (Cattani et al. 2017), fresh\nperspectives from users uninvolved in product de-\nsign (von Hippel 2017), and relevant knowledge from\nadjacent areas of expertise (Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010).\nIn this paper, we explore how core-periphery ten-\nsion manifests in online innovation communities. An on-\nline innovation community brings together participants\n752 pp. 752–775 Vol. 32, No. 3, MayJune 2021, –\n\n\nwith shared interests in a generative collaboration\nthrough the open sharing of ideas, experiences, per-\nspectives, problems, and solutions in order to sustain\nlearning and develop collective knowing. Such com-\nmunities form around wikis, question and answer\n(Q&A) sites, open-source software development, col-\nlaborative digital design platforms, and other forms of\nopen innovation (Faraj et al. 2016). By supporting\nknowledge exchange among thousands of dispersed\nparticipants, online innovation communities have\nunique characteristics t hat may impact knowledge\ncontributions. These communities typically form around\na shared ﬁeld of inquiry and offer participants a chance\nto learn both by observing knowledge ﬂows and by\nparticipating in community interactions (Faraj et al.\n2011, Preece 2000). Participation is usually open to\nanyone interested in joining together in the pursuit of\ncommon interests. Participants serve both as knowledge\nseekers and knowledge providers, and they also\ncomprise an interactive, collaborative audience that\nclariﬁes, elaborates on, and identi ﬁes the contribu-\ntions that are the most valuable. Finally, although\nmost participants rarely meet or interact with each\none beyond the online community, participation is\nrecognizably social and lea ds to strong connections\namong group members (Rheingold 1993,K r a u ta n d\nResnick 2011).\nWhere do knowledge contributions originate from\nin online innovation communities? Online community\nresearch —consistent with a community of practice\nperspective (Lave and Wenger 1991)—emphasizes\nthe importance of a central core of active, expert par-\nticipants for community sustenance and knowledge\nproduction (O ’Mahony and Ferraro 2007,D a h l a n d e r\nand O ’Mahony 2011, Levina and Arriaga 2014, Faraj\net al. 2015) and suggests that valuable contributions\nprimarily arise from this core. Indeed, a small per-\ncentage of community participants contribute most\ncontent and, accordingly, play a dominant role in\nongoing community maintenance and the produc-\ntion of knowledge (Dahlander and Frederiksen 2012,\nJohnson et al. 2015 ). In contrast, open innovation\nresearchers have emphasized the role of novel idea\nsources in the generation of valuable knowledge (von\nHippel 2005 , Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010,B o g e r se ta l .\n2017). In this view, creativit y and innovation origi-\nnate from marginal participants, from beyond the\nprimary ﬁeld of inquiry.\nTo integrate these con ﬂicting perspectives, we in-\nvestigate the relationship between a participant ’s\nposition in a knowledge ﬁeld and how the audience\nof fellow participants values their contributions. To\ninform our understanding of where valued contri-\nbutions originate, we analyzed data from online in-\nnovation communities hosted by Stack Exchange, an\nonline knowledge platform. Through our analysis,we demonstrate the import ance of considering two\ndistinct forms of position: a social position in the\nnetwork of social ties (who interacts with whom) and\nan epistemic position in the content-derived network\nof topics (who discusses what). Using a multilevel\nmixed-effects regression analysis of 52 Stack Ex-\nchange online innovation communities, encompass-\ning 1,906,434 quarterly contributions by 697,412\nparticipants over seven years, we ﬁnd that both core\nparticipants who are socially embedded and periph-\neral participants who are epistemically marginal pro-\nvide knowledge contributions that are highly valued\nby fellow community participants.1Furthermore, so-\ncial embeddedness complements epistemic margin-\nality: epistemically marg inal participants who are\nhigh on social embeddedness are those most likely to\nprovide highly valued con tributions. By showing\nhow social and epistemic positions interact in the\nproduction of knowledge, we provide a more nu-\nanced understanding of core-periphery tension in\nknowledge ﬁelds.\n2. Where Do Valuable Knowledge\nContributions Originate?\n2.1. Core-Periphery Tension in Knowledge Fields\nResearchers have long extolled the advantages of\nperipheral participants as sources of novelty and\nalternative perspectives (Merton 1973). As Gieryn\nand Hirsh ( 1983,p .8 7 )n o t e , “the‘marginal ’scien-\ntist who unexpectedly contributes major theoretical\nor technical innovations is part of the lore of science. ”\nYet, despite the widely recognized potential bene ﬁts\nof marginality as a source of valuable knowledge,\nthese advantages appear to be infrequently realized.\nOne explanation for the lack of contribution from\noutsiders is that the creation and development of\nknowledge within communities is a highly social\nprocess (Carlile 2002,N o n a k aa n dv o nK r o g h 2009,\nTsoukas 2009). The value of new knowledge contri-\nbutions can only be understood within the context\nof aﬁeld because knowledge itself is a situated and\nsocial accomplishment (Bourdieu 1993). Because of\nthe sticky, localized nature of knowledge, developing\nand sharing it requires common ground and contex-\ntualized shared mental models that arise among par-\nticipants through ﬁeld-speci ﬁc interactions (von Hippel\n1994,S z u l a n s k i 1996,A r g o t ee ta l . 2003). As a result,\nknowledge creation requires deep social interactions, a\nshared understanding of accepted practices for evalu-\nating new contributions, and an embrace of the gen-\nerative dance both between tacit and explicit knowledge,\nas well as between knowledge and knowing (Polanyi\n1958, Boland and Tenkasi 1995, Orlikowski 2002).\nHowever, there is no consensus regarding where\nvalued contributions are likely to emerge within aSafadi, Johnson, and Faraj: Core-Periphery Tension in Online Innovation Communities\nOrganization Science, 2021, vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 752–775, © 2020 The Author(s) 753\n\n\nknowledge ﬁeld. Phillips and Zuckerman ( 2001)i d e n -\ntiﬁed both the core and the periphery as sources of\nnovel ideas but argue that pe ripheral participants face\nobstacles in gaining recognition, legitimacy, and ac-\nceptance for their new ideas because they lack the\nsocial standing and resource advantages of insiders.\nIn communities of knowing, core participants often\npossess high levels of expertise, social capital, and\nresources (Collins 1998, Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998),\nwhich enable them to effectively express and develop\nideas that otherwise may not resonate with others in the\nﬁeld. Meanwhile, a competing perspective emphasizes\nthat peripheral participants provide unique experi-\nences, expertise, and problem-solving approaches.\nBy leveraging diverse and unique experiences, out-\nsiders with expertise in distant ﬁelds can contribute\nnovel ideas that would not be apparent to insiders and\nhelp resolve previously unsolvable problems (Jeppesen\nand Lakhani 2010, Majchrzak et al. 2018). By using\nalternative ways of thinking about problems and strat-\negies for identifying solutions, marginal participants can\nserve as catalysts in the problem-solving process (Gieryn\nand Hirsh 1983,A f u a ha n dT u c c i 2012).\nFinally, a third perspecti ve suggests that partici-\np a n t si na ni n t e r m e d i a t ep o s i t i o nb e t w e e nt h ec o r e\nand the periphery may enjoy unique bene ﬁts that\nenhance their ability to make valued contributions.\nThese participants can garner social legitimacy and\nsupport by virtue of their closeness to the core while\nbeneﬁting from the new ideas and inputs that emerge\nat the periphery of the network. For example, in their\nstudy of the motion picture industry from 1992 to\n2003, Cattani and Ferriani ( 2008 )f o u n dt h a ti n d i -\nviduals with an intermediate position garnered the\nmost awards. Likewise, a study of an online innova-\ntion community supporting digital audio producers\nfound that the most innovative participants resided\nat a midpoint between the core and the periphery\n(Dahlander and Frederiksen 2012 ).\nWhere valuable ideas arise within a knowledge\nﬁeld may be affected by facilitating conditions such as\ncommunity needs, external jolts, and audience ex-\npectations. For example, in a study investigating the\nsuccess of the Cubism movement in gaining accep-\ntance within the ﬁeld of ﬁne arts, Sgourev ( 2013)\nfound that core participants, concerned by an in-\ncreasingly fragmented ﬁne arts market, became more\nreceptive to what they originally viewed as an un-\nwelcome approach to painting. Likewise, when an-\nalyzing the legitimation of outsider John Harrison ’s\ninnovative approach to measuring longitude at sea,\nCattani et al. ( 2017 ) found that external jolts (i.e.,\nresponse to a major maritime disaster) can raise the\nurgency of ﬁnding a solution and thus propel an\noutsider ’s innovative solution toward acceptance.\nAdditionally, the characteristics of the idea itself maybe packaged in ways that facilitate acceptance. For\nexample, an analysis of Thomas Edison ’ss y s t e mo f\nelectric illumination showed that its integration of\ndesign elements familiar to gaslight users —such as\nlampshades, burners, gas statutes, and metered billing —\neased its integration into e xisting usage patterns and\nuser lifestyles (Hargadon and Douglas 2001 ). Finally,\ndifferent audiences may e valuate the same contri-\nbution differently. In the ﬁlm industry, for instance,\npeer audiences were unlikely to value contributions\nfrom the periphery, while critic audiences not only\n“fail to privilege core incumbents, but they actually\nfavor peripheral producers when awarding acco-\nlades ”(Cattani et al. 2014,p .2 7 6 ) .\n2.2. Valued Knowledge in Online\nInnovation Communities\nMany online settings —including online social media\nlike Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit —are reminiscent\nofgreat good places such as pubs, coffee shops, book-\nstores, and other community centers that promote\npublic association, debate, and social engagement\n(Oldenburg 1989). Online innovation communities\nhave similar sociality, but as places where knowledge\nis shared, they also align with the ethos of scienti ﬁc\nﬁelds. Built on the assumption that knowledge is\ncumulative, they are guided by a logic of discovery.\nThey bring together participants who share an in-\nterest in the concepts and practices of a complex area\nof inquiry. Much like the concept of research programs\nof Lakatos ( 1978), online innovation communities are\nconcerned with deepening knowledge within a speci ﬁc\ndomain of interest. In contrast to ﬁelds of science,\nhowever, online innovation communities do not bene ﬁt\nfrom established structures that allow science to pro-\nceed in a more or less orderly fashion. They lack the\ninstitutional structures and processes through which\nscience operates, such as journals, editors, a formal\nreview process, and conferences. Thus, online innova-\ntion communities may appear more closely aligned\nwith the idea of epistemological anarchy of Feyerabend\n(1975) than an academic discipline.\nThe open nature of online innovation communities —\nwith ﬂuid membership, public visibility of all in-\nteractions, and no formal positions of authority —\nfavors a highly social process. As observed by the\nstudy of scienti ﬁcﬁelds by Knorr-Cetina ( 1999), social\nrelations play a major role in what types of contri-\nbutions are valued and what passes for knowledge.\nScience-like norms structur e the interactions that take\nplace, the equality of participation, and the regulating\nprocess (Longino 2002). Similarly, an online innovation\ncommunity coalesces around an arena of knowledge,\nthe problems the community deems worth addressing,\nmethods for justifying solutions, and strategies for\nsolving problems encountered in practice. Furthermore,Safadi, Johnson, and Faraj: Core-Periphery Tension in Online Innovation Communities\nOrganization Science, 2021, vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 752–775, © 2020 The Author(s) 754\n\n\ngiven the widespread use of pseudonyms by partic-\nipants, which typically obscure institutional af ﬁlia-\ntion, social cues and authority status play a dimin-\nished role in the process of contributing knowledge.\nAt the same time, this process is necessarily social,\nprioritizes the demonstration of expertise, and involves\na convergent process of moving toward —if not a sin-\ngular truth —a collective vetting of useful knowledge.\nBecause online innovation communities have few\nbarriers to entry and attract a ﬂow of new participants\nwho bring in novel insights and perspectives, they\nmust balance open participation with the need to\nestablish and maintain sustainable behavior norms\n(Ma and Agarwal 2007,K r a u ta n dR e s n i c k 2011, Faraj\net al. 2015). Participants intera ct by sharing ideas and\nexperiences, debating practices, and helping each\nother solve problems. This collaborative spirit contrasts\nwith innovation contests and other crowd-sourcing\nplatforms where knowledge seekers pose bespoke\nproblems for their own bene ﬁt and offer monetary\nrewards to the individuals (or teams) that indepen-\ndently generate the best solution (Lakhani 2016 ). It\nalso differs from other online settings where the focus is\non matching knowledge seekers with knowledge pro-\nviders (Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010,H a a se ta l . 2015).\nInstead, in online innovation communities, the knowl-\nedge process is emergent and dialogic in nature; par-\nticipants clarify and elaborate for each other, building\non partial answers, and work together to validate new\nknowledge (Kudaravalli and Faraj 2008,T s o u k a s\n2009). Thus, the knowledge process is relationally com-\nplex and contingent on social and epistemic norms.\n2.3. Social Embeddedness and\nEpistemic Marginality\nLike other social ﬁelds, participants in online inno-\nvation communities are embedded in a network of\nsocial interactions: they occupy a range of positions\nfrom core insiders to marginal outsiders. Building\non a network perspective to examine participants ’\ninteractions (Borgatti and Everett 1999 ), we use the\nterms embeddedness and marginality to denote oppo-\nsite ends of a core-periphery continuum: embedd-\nedness is equivalent to a central position; marginality\nto a peripheral position. Historically, the content of\nﬂows in a network, although viewed as important,\nw a sa s s u m e dt ob ei m m e a s u r a b l ei np r a c t i c e( B o r g a t t i\nand Lopez-Kidwell 2011). Thus, previous conceptu-\nalizations of position in a network have singularly\nfocused on measuring ties without considering the\nknowledge ﬂowing through those ties. Today, the\nvisibility of online interactions affords the observa-\ntion of human behavior with greater precision and, in\nturn, the development of a multidimensional con-\nceptualization and understanding of social phenomena\n(Latour 2010,L a z e re ta l . 2009) .A tt h es a m et i m e ,t h eonline availability of a con tent corpus affords dif-\nferentiation between a social network (who knows or\ninteracts with whom) and a topic network (who is\nconversing about what). This distinction enables sep-\narate analyses of the two networks to provide a rich\ncharacterization of the community and the social and\nepistemic positions of its participants.\nParticipants in online innovation communities pos-\nsess diverse social and positional capital that can in-\nﬂuence how systems of meaning are negotiated within\nthe community. Socially embedded participants are\nbest positioned to understand what constitutes a novel\ncontribution compared with existing content, to rec-\nognize topics of interest to the community, and to\ncommunicate most effectively in the manner consis-\ntent with community norms (Qureshi and Fang 2011,\nRullani and Hae ﬂiger2013, Levina and Arriaga 2014,\nJohnson et al. 2015 ). Ful ﬁlling the espoused goal of\nbuilding knowledge —in the sense of developing\ncommunity-validated useful knowledge —involves a\nprocess of interactive dialogue, the setting of contextual\nconditions, and the deepening of shades of difference\n(Nonaka and von Krogh 2009 ,H a d j i m i c h a e la n d\nTsoukas 2019). This deepening of perspective mak-\ning involves the construction and alignment of spe-\nciﬁc narratives and the raising of communal boundaries\nregarding topics of relevance (Boland and Tenkasi 1995,\nBrown and Duguid 2001). Thus, through repeated\ninteractions, socially embe dded participants develop\ndifferentiated expertise and mastery of community\nlanguage and expectation s, gains that allow them to\noffer valuable contributions.\nThe importance of an authoritative core of com-\nmunity experts is consistent with ﬁndings that a\nrelatively small number of online participants con-\ntribute the majority of content (Kudaravalli and Faraj\n2008, Dahlander and O ’Mahony 2011 , Rullani and\nHaeﬂiger2013,J o h n s o ne ta l . 2014 ). Prior research on\nvirtual collaboration envi ronments found that more\ncentral participants were viewed as more in ﬂuential\nby other participants (Sutanto et al. 2011, Johnson\net al. 2014). Studying the Linux Debian community,\nO’Mahony and Ferraro ( 2007 ) found that the com-\nmunity operated as a meritocracy and that sustained\ninteraction with other participants increased the pro-\npensity of a community participant becoming a leader.\nFurthermore, in a survey of participants in an online\nimmigration lawyer community, Wasko and Faraj\n(2005) found a positive relationship between a par-\nticipant ’s self-reported expertise and their centrality\nin online community discussions. Given that online\ninnovation communities are open, weakly structured\nsocial ﬁelds, that social presence is enacted primarily\nthrough written communication, and that participants\nfocus on deepening highly contextualized knowledge,\nwe argue that socially embedded participants are moreSafadi, Johnson, and Faraj: Core-Periphery Tension in Online Innovation Communities\nOrganization Science, 2021, vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 752–775, © 2020 The Author(s) 755\n\n\nlikely to provide knowledge contributions that are val-\nued by the community audience. Therefore, we propose:\nProposition 1. In online innovation communities, social\nembeddedness is positively associated with providing valued\nknowledge contributions.\nOnline innovation community participants are united\nby what Knorr-Cetina ( 1999)c a l l e da ne p i s t e m i cc u l -\nture: a set of norms, arrangements, and mechanisms\nthat make up what and how they know. The availability\nof digital traces offers a promising avenue to more\ncomprehensively evaluate i nteractions, expressions,\nand social action in the making of knowledge compared\nwith predigital approaches to studying knowledge\nproduction, which lacked access to traces of such ac-\ntivities (Hampton 2017, Lazer and Radford 2017).\nConsidering the content of exchanges opens up the\npossibility of identifying who engages on which\ntopics. Each participant ’s contributions re ﬂect a unique\nepistemic position based on their perspective, experi-\nence, and expertise. Thus, in online innovation com-\nmunities, participants not only occupy a social position\nbased on whom they interact with, but also a distinct\nepistemic position based on the content of their con-\ntributions. As a result and for example, we can con-\nceptualize a participant as epistemically marginal to the\nextent that the topics they discuss are distant from the\ndominant discourse of the community.\nThis conceptualization aligns with a recent exam-\nination of the role of intellectual dissimilarity or\ndistance in online knowled ge production. In a study\nof 2,130 evaluator –proposal pairs for academic re-\nsearch seed grants, Boudreau et al. ( 2016)i d e n t i f y\nintellectual distance based on differences between\nevaluator expertise and proposal topic areas, as mea-\nsured by the overlap of keywords re ﬂecting evaluator\nexpertise and proposal content. Likewise, Jeppesen and\nLakhani ( 2010) identify technical marginality based\non the dissimilarity of a participant ’se x p e r t i s et oa\nfocal problem, which they measure as a self-assessed\nestimate of the distance between a solver ’sﬁeld of\nexpertise and the problem th ey addressed. Similarly,\nin a study of evaluations of 105,127 crowdsourced\nsuggestions provided to 922 organizations, Piezunka\nand Dahlander ( 2015 ) identify content distance based\non the dissimilarity of word-usage frequency in new\nsuggestions compared with previously considered\nsuggestions. Thus, a participant ’s epistemic position\nin aﬁeld is re ﬂected in the content of their contri-\nbutions, which is separate and distinct from their\nsocial position based on int erpersonal interactions.\nSeveral characteristics of online innovation com-\nmunities may reduce barri ers to the acceptance of\nnovel, innovative solutions generated by peripheral\nparticipants. Online commu nities frequently embrace\negalitarian expectations tha t contributions are judgedbased on the value of their content rather than on the\nidentity of the author (O ’Mahony and Ferraro 2007).\nIndeed, the pragmatic nature of valuing knowledge —\nis a contribution useful? —places greater emphasis\non the content of contributions than on who provides\nit. In addition, open access reduces barriers to par-\nticipation: few restrictions limit who can join a com-\nmunity, view existing content, or contribute new\ncontent. Participants with relevant expertise can im-\nmediately begin making contributions. Furthermore,\nonline innovation communities offer opportunities\nfor both newcomers and experienced participants to\nadopt situationally speci ﬁcr o l e sb a s e do ne m e r g e n t\nneeds (Faraj et al. 2011 ). Finally, by allowing partic-\nipants to hide their real-world identities (e.g., name or\norganizational af ﬁliation), online communities can en-\ncourage uninhibited participation (Sproull and Kiesler\n1991,K r a u ta n dR e s n i c k 2011). Therefore, epistemi-\ncally marginal participants may face reduced barriers to\nactive engagement in online innovation communities.\nEmpirical studies of open innovation contests point\nto the importance of outsiders in generating creative\nsolutions. For example, in a study of more than 12,000\nscientists participating in 166 science problem-solving\nchallenges, Jeppesen and Lakhani ( 2010)f o u n dt h a t\ntechnical marginality, as measured by the conceptual\ndistance between a participant ’s technical expertise\nand the source ﬁeld of the problem, was associated\nwith providing successful solutions. Likewise, in a\nstudy of 14 open innovation challenges sponsored by\nNASA, the solutions provided by outsiders consid-\nerably outperformed thos e of internal research and\ndesign (R&D) engineers (Lifshitz-Assaf 2018). Simi-\nlarly, in a study analyzing 8,801 ideas generated by\n4,285 participants in the ﬁr s tt w oy e a r so fD e l l ’s\nIdeastorm community, Bayus ( 2012)f o u n dt h a tp e -\nripheral participants provided more diverse, higher\nquality solutions than core participants. Thus, we\nsuggest that epistemically marginal participants may\nbe particularly valuable because they offer more\ncreative solutions or fresh insights to complex prob-\nlems that cannot be solved by marshaling the com-\nmunity ’s established knowledge. Therefore, we pro-\npose the following.\nProposition 2. In online innovation communities, episte-\nmic marginality is positively associated with providing\nvalued knowledge contributions.\nThese arguments offer an explanation of why val-\nued knowledge contributions may arise from either\nsocially embedded (Proposition 1) or epistemically\nmarginal (Proposition 2) participants. The essence of\ncore-periphery tension is the observation that partici-\npants who are best equipped to make a novel contri-\nbution are quite frequently also in a disadvantaged\nsocial position in a knowledge ﬁeld. Extant research hasSafadi, Johnson, and Faraj: Core-Periphery Tension in Online Innovation Communities\nOrganization Science, 2021, vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 752–775, © 2020 The Author(s) 756\n\n\nlargely considered the core and the periphery as end-\npoints on a single scale where a participant can only\nbe in a single position —t h ec o r eo rt h ep e r i p h e r y .\nSpeci ﬁcally, past research has often viewed the social\nand epistemic position as concomitant and mutually\nconstitutive, such that a core or peripheral position in\none dimension strongly suggests an equivalent po-\nsition in the other. Leverag ing the visibility of online\ninteractions facilitates di sentangling social and epi-\nstemic positions and, accordingly, opens up the ability\nto consider participants who are both epistemically\nmarginal and socially embedded.\nIn online innovation communities, a participant\nbeneﬁtting from high epistemic marginality and high\nsocial embeddedness could leverage the advantages\nof both. By virtue of their epistemic marginality, such\nparticipants could offer novel ideas, while by virtue of\ntheir social embeddedness they may be able to more\neffectively communicate those ideas to the commu-\nnity. As has long been noted, because participants in\nthe social core feel secure about their social position,\nthey may be more willing to actively seek out and\npromote novel ideas (Phillips and Zuckerman 2001).\nFor participants, getting a novel solution accepted\nrequired dexterous navigation of the social ﬁeld.\nMore speci ﬁcally, participants ’persistent social en-\ngagement enables their ideas to overcome initial\nskepticism and opposition (Cattani et al. 2017). As an\nexample, epistemically marginal health professionals\nwere able to achieve the adoption of their expert\nrecommendations by build ing and emphasizing their\nsocial connection to participants embedded in the\nsocial core (DiBenigno 2020 ). Finally, in online set-\ntings, the most in ﬂuential participants were those\nable to customize their language to re ﬂect the ac-\ncepted norms and values of the community (Johnson\net al. 2015). Thus, epistemically marginal participants\nmay bene ﬁt from high social embeddedness —in terms\nof a tacit understanding of norms, dominant frames,\nand community language —in order to more effec-\ntively establish their novel contributions. Therefore,\nwe propose the following.\nProposition 3. In online innovation communities, social\nembeddedness strengthens the positive association between\nepistemic marginality and valued knowledge contributions.\nFigure 1provides a visual summary of the three\npropositions and the relationships among social\nembeddedness, epistemic marginality, and valued\nknowledge contributions in online innovation com-\nmunities explored in this paper.\n3. Research Setting\nTo test our propositions we perform an empirical\nanalysis of contributions to Stack Exchange, a platform\nsupporting over one hundred communities “that arecreated and run by experts and enthusiasts...who are\npassionate about a speci ﬁct o p i c ”and provide “an-\nswers to practical, detailed questions ”(Anonymous\n2019d ). Stack Exchange communities provide par-\nticipants with a supportive community in which they\ncan gain valuable information, be exposed to crea-\ntive ideas and ways of thinking about problems, and\nhave access to motivated experts jointly engaged in\nproblem solving. As a place where participants en-\ngage with challenging problems, Stack Exchange\nfacilitates participants ’learning and supports inno-\nvation within organizations. Stack Exchange started\nin 2006 as a single community for computer pro-\ngrammers (Stack Over ﬂow) and expanded in 2010\ninto a network of stacks related primarily to tech-\nnology but also additional domains, including busi-\nness, arts, and science. With 5.1 billion visits in 2018\nand 9.5 million registered users (as of January 2019),\nStack Exchange is one of the world ’s most popular\nweb destinations (Anonymous 2019c ).\nT h ee x a m p l es h o w ni nF i g u r e 2illustrates the so-\ncial processes that participants engage in to expand\ncommunity understanding of complex knowledge\ntopics. The question titled “Create a unterminable\nprocess in Windows ”was posted by “user20825 ”to\nthe Information Security stack (Anonymous 2019a ).\n(This question is indicative of typical questions across\na variety of stacks; Table A in the online appendix lists\ntitles of questions with similar complexity in other\nstacks.) The initial comments on the question (shown\nimmediately below the question) provide skeptical\nresponses. The ﬁrst comment (posted by “tylerl ”)u s e s\nhumor to question the question ’s premise. The second\ncomment (posted by “Bob Watson ”) helpfully pro-\nvides three links to extern al information sources\nwith a summary of their content. Such a response,\nsuccinct and authoritative, implies that the question\nhas already been addressed elsewhere. At the same\ntime, two contemporaneous responses (not shown\nin the ﬁgure) express skepticism that the question can\nbe satisfactorily answered. Then, “Polynomial ”pro-\nvides a long, detailed answer that refutes the emerging\nconsensus, summarizing 10 different potential methods\nto achieve the original question ’so b j e c t i v e s .T h i sa n -\ns w e rw a sm a r k e da sa na c c e p t e da n s w e rb yt h eFigure 1.

Thus, the community as a whole serves as an\ninteractive audience tha t, through votes and com-\nments, encourages (or disco urages) lines of thinking\nand focuses attention on both topics of interest and\nthe most promising lines of inquiry. The community is\nitself the arbiter of what is a useful contribution.\nFurthermore, there is no clear separation between\nnovices, peers, and experts. All participants (regard-\nless of their tenure or expertise) can ask questions\nand contribute answers. This egalitarian approach is\nexpressed in the website interface, which minimizes\nparticipants ’identity markers. Participants can op-\ntionally disclose information in a personalized pro ﬁle\n(including geographic location and links to social\nmedia accounts), but quite limited pro ﬁle information\nis shown in Q&A threads, and even then, only for the\nquestion and answer authors, not individual com-\nmenters. In Figure 2, where the answer author ’sn a m e\nis shown ( “Polynomial ”), a small user pro ﬁle picture\nappears along with counts and icons signifying a\nreputation score of more than 104K, 36 gold badges,\n253 silver badges, and 346 bronze badges. Notably,\neven when other proli ﬁcp a r t i c i p a n t sp r o v i d ev a l u e d\ncomments (such as “tylerl ”in this example), no addi-\ntional identi ﬁcation is noted as such on their comments.\nFinally, although participants remain on topic ,t h e ya r e\nalso sociable. That is, responses re ﬂect a collective striv-\ning for common understanding; at the same time, re-\nspondents often signal that they have read each other ’s\nre
